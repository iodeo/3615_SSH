Excellent work from [jbellue](https://github.com/jbellue/3615_SSH) adapted for minitel-esp32 devboard.

I just changed the serial port to fit with minitel-esp32 devboard !

3615_SSH is a SSH session client with a nice UI to manage host info and connexion using minitel keyboard.

It makes possible to e.g. monitor your RaspPi from a minitel like you would do with putty.

The project is build with [platformio](https://platformio.org/) and use lib-deps to handle external libraries from url straightly.

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is needed for this.

Set-up with windows os is:
* vs code installed 
* platformio extension installed from vs code
* git installed

Minitel ESP32 dev board is [available on tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/25418/) !
