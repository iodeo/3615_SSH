Excellent work from [jbellue](https://github.com/jbellue/3615_SSH) adapted for minitel-esp32 devboard.

Just changed the serial port to fit with my devboard.

The project is build with [platformio](https://platformio.org/) and use lib-deps to handle external libraries from url straightly.

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is needed for this.

Set-up with windows os is:
* vs code installed 
* platformio extension installed from vs code
* git installed
